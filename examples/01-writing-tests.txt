Step 1: Initializing Ralph for the project...
  - Ran: bun run dev init --agent droid --force
  - Created .ralph/ directory with prompt templates
  - Agent: Factory Droid
  - Status: SUCCESS

Step 2: Creating test specification...
  - Created .ralph/specs/testing.md with comprehensive test requirements
  - Tests for: config module, agents, path utilities, templates
  - Using Bun's built-in test runner
  - Status: SUCCESS

Step 3: Updating project configuration...
  - Updated .ralph/AGENTS.md with correct bun commands
  - Added test script to package.json
  - Status: SUCCESS

Step 4: Starting Ralph in plan mode...
  - First attempt failed: droid flag conflict (--auto vs --skip-permissions-unsafe)
  - Fixed bug in src/agents/droid.ts - removed --skip-permissions-unsafe
  - Retry succeeded!
  - Session ID: d709bbf0
  - Droid analyzed 2 specs, 16 source files
  - Updated .ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with prioritized tasks
  - Found existing bug to fix + test suite as high priority
  - Status: SUCCESS

Step 5: Starting Ralph in build mode to create tests...
  - Session ID: f470bd29
  - Ran 2 iterations
  - Droid created 4 test files:
    - src/__tests__/config.test.ts (11 tests)
    - src/__tests__/agents.test.ts (19 tests)
    - src/__tests__/paths.test.ts (13 tests)
    - src/__tests__/templates.test.ts (9 tests)
  - Total: 52 tests, all passing
  - Also fixed bug: redundant specs directory creation in config.ts
  - Created git tag v1.0.1
  - Status: SUCCESS
