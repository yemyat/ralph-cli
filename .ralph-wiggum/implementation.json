Should extend existing e2e-loop.test.ts pattern (src/__tests__/e2e-loop.test.ts) with mock agent that captures prompts to temp files. Tests verify task isolation (agent gets one task, not full spec) and retry context injection. Existing infrastructure: task-prompts.ts (generateTaskPrompt, generateRetryPrompt), implementation.ts (task state management), quality-gates.ts (runQualityGates), start.ts (runTaskLevelLoop at line 511).",
